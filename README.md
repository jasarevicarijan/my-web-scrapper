# My first Web Scraper try with TypeScript and Node.js

This is a repository for a simple Web Scraper .

When we run our script from the command line, it will execute `getData()`. That function will fetch the HTML from Hacker News' front page, extract all of the links and their titles, and then save it to `data/hacker-news-links.json`.

### Cloning the repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/jasarevicarijan/my-web-scrapper.git
```

### Install packages

```shell
npm i
```

### Start the app

```shell
npm run scrape
```
